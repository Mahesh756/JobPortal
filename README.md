**JobPortal Project**

  -- This JobPortal project demonstrates a clean and scalable implementation of stateless, token-based, and role-based authentication using Spring Boot. It covers the following key features:

  **Stateless Authentication:** No server-side session storage; authentication relies entirely on tokens.
  
  **Token-Based Security:** Uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to securely manage user sessions.
  
  **Role-Based Access Control:** Grants access based on user roles, ensuring secure and organized authorization.
  
  **Scalable Design:** Follows clean architecture principles for maintainability and extensibility.

This project is ideal for learning secure Spring Boot application design, implementing JWT authentication, and managing role-based access control in modern web applications.
